1. Purpose

This file provides the governed scenario-to-rule mapping for the Financial Resilience (FIN) domain.

The FIN Rule Engine uses this index to identify the authoritative rule applicable to a selected financial resilience scenario.

The rule selected by this index must be evaluated before a FIN scenario is passed to the SPD v13.1 Captain AI Lena Golden Rule decision pipeline.

3. Rule Mapping

FIN-001 — FX Stress

Rule File:

"FIN/FIN-001.md"

Primary evaluation:

- Exchange-rate volatility

- Liquidity conditions
- Market confidence

Cascade:

"FX Stress → Inflation Pressure → Interest Rate Pressure → Liquidity Tightening → Financial Market Stress"

---

"BOND_OUTFLOW"

Rule File:

"FIN/FIN-002.md"

Primary evaluation:

- Government bond yields
- Foreign investor participation
- Bond trading volume
- Market volatility
- Capital outflows
- Credit spreads

Cascade:

"Bond Outflow → Higher Borrowing Costs → Liquidity Tightening → Financial Market Stress"

---

FIN-003 — Liquidity Stress

"FIN/FIN-004.md"

Primary evaluation:

- Capital adequacy
- Non-performing loans
- Loan-to-deposit ratio
- Deposit withdrawals
- Interbank funding
- Bank funding spreads

Cascade:

"Banking Stress → Credit Tightening → Reduced Lending → Economic Slowdown"

---

FIN-005 — Inflation Shock

Scenario IDs:

Rule File:

"FIN/FIN-005.md"

Primary evaluation:

- CPI
- Core inflation
- PPI
- Interest rates

4. Standard FIN Evaluation Procedure

Every FIN scenario must follow this procedure:

5. Risk Classification

FIN rules use the following governed risk structure:

GREEN

Normal conditions.

System response:

"MONITOR"

No contingency escalation required.

YELLOW

Early warning conditions.

System response:

"INCREASE_MONITORING"

Review indicators and prepare for possible escalation.

ORANGE

Significant stress.

System response:

"PREPARE_CONTINGENCY"

Strengthen monitoring and prepare appropriate resilience measures.

RED

Severe systemic stress.

System response:

"ESCALATE_SYSTEMIC_RESPONSE"

Institutional emergency procedures may be recommended subject to appropriate human authority.

---

6. Cross-Domain Cascade

FIN scenarios may interact with other resilience domains.

Primary dependency structure:

FIN
 ↓
INF
 ↓
CYB
 ↓
DC

Additional domains may be activated when the selected rule identifies a relevant dependency.

The FIN Rule Engine must identify affected domains but must not independently execute actions in another domain.

Cross-domain execution remains subject to that domain's rule engine and the SPD human authorization framework.

7. Captain AI Lena Integration

After FIN rule evaluation, the result is passed to the SPD v13.1 Golden Rule Engine:

OBSERVE
   ↓
VERIFY
   ↓
ASSESS
   ↓
DECIDE
   ↓
ACT
   ↓
UPDATE

Captain AI Lena receives:

- Selected FIN rule
- Scenario
- Scenario intensity
- Evaluated indicators
- Risk level
- Resilience assessment
- Cascade path
- Affected domains
- Contingency options
- Execution authority

---

8. Execution Authority

The FIN Rule Engine is a decision-support component.

It does not possess independent execution authority.

DECISION SUPPORT
       ↓
CAPTAIN AI LENA
       ↓
RECOMMENDATION
       ↓
HUMAN OPERATOR
       ↓
AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED
       ↓
EXECUTION

Monitoring-only recommendations may be recorded without execution authorization.

Any recovery, intervention, mitigation, or operational execution action requires human authorization.

9. Required Simulation Output

Every FIN evaluation should produce:

Rule ID
Rule Version
Domain
Scenario
Scenario Intensity
Indicators
Assessment
Risk Level
Resilience Score
Cascade Path
Affected Domains
Contingency Actions
Captain AI Lena Recommendation
Execution Authority
Execution Status
Memory Record
Audit Record
Timestamp

---

10. Audit Requirements

Each FIN evaluation must record:

- Rule ID
- Rule version
- Scenario
- Domain
- Input state
- Intensity
- Assessment result
- Risk classification
- Resilience score
- Decision
- Execution authority
- Execution status
- Human authorization status where applicable
- Timestamp

The audit record must provide sufficient information to reconstruct the simulation decision.
